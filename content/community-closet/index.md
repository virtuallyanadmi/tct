## What is the Community Closet?

It is a ministry ran by Calvary Temple that provides clothing to anyone.

## Where is it located?

The clothing closet is located at the back right corner of our property in the metal building.

## How does it work?

If you cannot afford to buy clothing but need clothes there are several agencies or churches in the area that have referral forms. You request a referral form from one of those agencies and bring it to our facility along with a photo ID during the hours of operation. You then will receive 1 bag per person listed on your form for FREE. You may come with a new referral form once a month.

## What if I can afford the clothing and don’t need a referral form?

Great! You can shop as much as you want and will only be charged $7 per bag of clothes.

## What kind of clothes does the Clothing Closet have?

It has all sizes for men, women, juniors, children, and babies. We have plus sizes and some maternity too.

## What condition are the clothes in?

They are in good to excellent condition. The volunteers never put out anything that has a stain or tear on it. They do their best to keep “up to date” clothing out.

## What time is the closet open?

They are open on Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday from 9 a.m. until Noon.  
They are always closed on holidays and if there is bad weather..

## Where can I drop off a donation?

There is a yellow shed on our property where you can drop off your donations or feel free to drop them by the church office during business hours.

## What donations do you accept?

Toys, household items, furniture, bicycles, strollers etc. please call for an appointment if the items are not clothing.
