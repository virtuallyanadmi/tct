When your child comes to Calvary Temple’s nursery they will be cared for with the utmost love and compassion. We love children. All of our nursery workers have undergone background checks. We see children as the future church. They are precious to Jesus and precious to us.

There are many toys for them to play with, all age appropriate.

There is plenty of room for the children to crawl, play, run or toddle. On the baby side, there are baby cribs, swings, bouncers, and saucers. On the toddlers side there are toys galore, books, rocking horse, etc.

Our nursery is kept clean and sanitized. There is a restroom located in our nursery.
