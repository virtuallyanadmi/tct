## Ranger Kids: Kindergarten-2nd grade

The Ranger Kids Advancement Trail is based on the needs, interest and characteristics of boys in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade. The Trail is a plan of advancement through learning—from both experiences and activities—and being recognized for their learning. It is designed to offer every boy adventure and fun. The Trail is more than an interesting course of action; it is a new experience—a new achievement. It is a Ranger’s opportunity to grow through new abilities, knowledge, and desires.

## Discovery Rangers: 3rd-5th grade

Being a Discovery Ranger will give a boy many chances to do new things. He will learn new skills, like camping, building models, giving first aid, and cooking while learning about God and His Word. Royal Rangers will give him the chance to be rewarded for finishing merits and steps on the Advancement Trail.

## Adventure Rangers: 6th-8th grade

Every great challenge a young man accepts helps to build his character, increase his determination to achieve, and improve his ability to set goals and fulfill them. The Adventure Rangers Advancement Trail offers such a challenge in the Trail to the Adventure Gold Award.

## Expedition Rangers: 9th-12th grade

The focus of the advancement trail is to help boys develop into young men who have the skills to make good sound decisions, strong moral character, exemplify leadership skills, and are founded in the Word of God.  The advancement system in Expedition Rangers consists of these three awards:

-   E1 Award – typically earned after one full year of involvement in the program
-   E2 Award – typically earned after a second full year in the program
-   E3 Award – typically earned after a third full year in the program
