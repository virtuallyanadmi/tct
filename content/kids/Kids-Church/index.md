We here at Calvary Temple believe that children are precious to God and that means they are precious to us. We want you as a parent to know that ALL of our children’s workers and volunteers have undergone background checks. Children are our future and they are our future church.

## Little Kids Church - 3-6 years old

They are located in a room designated for their age group on the Lower Level. Little Kids Church begins right before the Message. Each week the teacher helps them learn about God, while having a very fun time. “Little Kids Church” has game time, prayer time, snack time, story time (Veggie Tales), Worship time, and various forms of play time.

## Big Kids Church - 6-11 years old

They are located in the fellowship hall in the Lower Level. Big Kids Church begins right before the Message. Each week the teacher helps them learn about God, while having a fun time too. “Big Kids Church” has all the fun, but does it on an “older” scale. The children are learning how to be what Jesus wants them to be, along with many other relevant biblical principles.
