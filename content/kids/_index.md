<h2 class="tight-header">Sunday Mornings</h2> at 10:15am

<br />

**CT Kids** are designed to **help families raise disciples** to **find and follow Jesus** and to foster an understanding of scripture as we grow together through teaching, worship, praying, games and building relationships.  **CT Kids** classes are available for **in-person gatherings** and we couldn't be more excited! Join us on **Sunday mornings** for teaching, worship and an overall fun time.
